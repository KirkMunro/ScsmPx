The ScsmPx module facilitates automation with Microsoft System Center Service
Manager by auto-loading the native modules that are included as part of that
product and enabling automatic discovery of the commands that are contained
within the native modules. It also includes dozens of complementary commands
that are not available out of the box to allow you to do much more with your
PowerShell automation efforts using the platform.
