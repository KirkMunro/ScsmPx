        <h3><a name="module-overview" class="anchor" href="#module-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An Overview of ScsmPx</h3>

        <p>
        The ScsmPx module facilitates automation with Microsoft System Center Service
        Manager by auto-loading the native modules that are included as part of that
        product and enabling automatic discovery of the commands that are contained
        within the native modules. It also includes dozens of complementary commands
        that are not available out of the box to allow you to do much more with your
        PowerShell automation efforts using the platform.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="install-module" class="anchor" href="#install-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the ScsmPx Module the Easy Way</h3>

        <p>
        The ScsmPx module is installed with a single PowerShell command. Note that
        you can update the ScsmPx module to the latest version at any time simply
        by running this command again.
        </p>

        <code>
        # If you want to install ScsmPx for all users or update a version already installed
        # (recommended, requires elevation for new install for all users)
        & ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -uri http://tinyurl.com/Install-GitHubHostedModule).Content)) -ModuleName ScsmPx,SnippetPx
        
        # If you want to install ScsmPx for the current user
        & ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -uri http://tinyurl.com/Install-GitHubHostedModule).Content)) -ModuleName ScsmPx,SnippetPx -Scope CurrentUser
        </code>

        <p>
        While installation via the online script is preferred, you can also manually
        install this module if you prefer. Both the ScsmPx module and the SnippetPx
        module that it is dependent on are hosted on GitHub at github.com/KirkMunro.
        I strongly recommend using the automated installation method though.
        </p>

        <li>your current user's "Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules" folder</li>
        <li>the "Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules" folder (for all users)</li>
        <li>any other folder where you want to install the module</li>

        <p>
        Note that it is strongly recommended that the folder you choose be included in
        the PSModulePath environment variable. If you are performing automation tasks
        using ScsmPx, you are required to choose a path that will be visible to the
        automation tasks' runas account. For automation purposes, the Program Files path
        is recommended.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once you have the module in place, rename the root folder of the module as
        "ScsmPx". At this point, manual setup of the module will be complete.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="how-to-use-the-module" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-the-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Use the ScsmPx Module</h3>

        <p>
        There are 157 commands available in the ScsmPx module today, and 116 cmdlets
        in the native modules, offering a total of 273 commands to make Microsoft
        System Center Service Manager automation easier. To see a list of all of the
        commands that are available in the ScsmPx and native modules, invoke the
        following commands:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=.Start-ScsmPxIntroduction.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        Note that when you first run these commands, there will be a short delay as the
        module is loaded into the PowerShell session (unless you have disabled module
        auto-loading in your environment, in which case you will have to invoke the
        Import&#8209;Module cmdlet first to manually import the ScsmPx module and the native
        SCSM modules that it loads for you).
        </p>

        <p>
        The first command will return a list of commands that are included in the
        native modules that ship with Microsoft System Center Service Manager. The
        second command will return a list of commands that are included in the
        ScsmPx module. Note that all ScsmPx module commands start with the ScsmPx
        noun prefix.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="get-scsmpxincident" class="anchor" href="#get-scsmpxincident"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Microsoft System Center Service Manager with ScsmPx</h4>

        <p>
        To see a list of all incidents that you have in your environment, invoke
        the following command:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Get-ScsmPxIncident1.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        This data represents individual instances of the System.WorkItem.Incident
        class, and it does not identify any of the objects that are related to those
        instances. Commands invoked like this allow for very efficient management of
        Microsoft System Center Service Manager object data. If you want to work
        with more complex data that includes multiple related instances combined
        into a single view, you can request a specific view of that data instead by
        using the -View parameter. For example, to see a more user friendly view of
        the incidents in your environment you could invoke the following command
        instead:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Get-ScsmPxIncident2.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        This data provides the same information that you see when you access the
        corresponding "All Incidents" view in the management console. Note that you
        cannot apply filters when you are looking up data using a view. In those
        cases, the filters that are defined as part of the view are used.
        </p>

        <p>
        To see what you can do with that data once you have it, have a look at the
        other ScsmPxIncident commands by invoking the following command:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Get-ScsmPxIncidentCommand.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        This identifies that there are other commands that work with incidents. To
        use these commands to modify incidents, you can leverage the pipeline. For
        example, to automatically close any incidents that have been resolved for
        more than 7 days, you could use the Set&#8209;ScsmPxIncident command in the
        following script:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Set-ScsmPxIncidentResolved.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        That demonstrates one simple example to a common problem that these commands
        can help resolve with little effort. Between PowerShell scripts, PowerShell
        workflows, Microsoft System Center Service Manager workflows, Microsoft
        System Center Orchestrator workflows, and now the new Service Management
        Automation (SMA) feature of Microsoft System Center Orchestrator, there are
        plenty of opportunities to use PowerShell commands to automate Microsoft
        System Center Service Manager. Experiment with the other commands in the
        ScsmPx module and see what solutions you can come up with.
