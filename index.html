        <h3><a name="module-overview" class="anchor" href="#module-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An Overview of ScsmPx</h3>

        <p>
        The ScsmPx module facilitates automation with Microsoft System Center Service
        Manager by auto-loading the native modules that are included as part of that
        product and enabling automatic discovery of the commands that are contained
        within the native modules. It also includes dozens of complementary commands
        that are not available out of the box to allow you to do much more with your
        PowerShell automation efforts using the platform.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="install-module" class="anchor" href="#install-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the ScsmPx Module the Easy Way</h3>

        <p>
        The ScsmPx module is installed in two steps. The first step is to download
        the installation script, and the second step is to invoke that installation
        script with parameters identifying where you want the module installed.
        Note that you can update the ScsmPx module to the latest version at any time
        simply by performing these steps again.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="download-installerscript" class="anchor" href="#download-installerscript"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download the ScsmPx Installer Script</h4>

        <p>
        To download the installation script, invoke the following script in the
        PowerShell console of your choice:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9765959.js?file=Copy-ScsmPxInstallerScript.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        Once you have run that script, your $installerScript variable will contain
        the path to the installer script file. You can then proceed with the module
        installation by running any one of the commands listed below.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="invoke-installerscript1" class="anchor" href="#invoke-installerscript1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install ScsmPx for the Current User</h4>

        <p>
        This command installs the ScsmPx module for the current user.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9765959.js?file=Invoke-ScsmPxInstallerScript1.ps1"> </script>

        <h4><a name="invoke-installerscript2" class="anchor" href="#invoke-installerscript2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install ScsmPx for All Users</h4>

        <p>
        This command installs the ScsmPx module for all users.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9765959.js?file=Invoke-ScsmPxInstallerScript2.ps1"> </script>

        <h4><a name="invoke-installerscript3" class="anchor" href="#invoke-installerscript3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install or Upgrade ScsmPx Using the Default Installation Path</h4>

        <p>
        This command upgrades the ScsmPx module in its current location. If it is has not
        been installed yet, this command will install the ScsmPx module for the current
        user.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9765959.js?file=Invoke-ScsmPxInstallerScript3.ps1"> </script>

        <h3><a name="manual-install" class="anchor" href="#manual-install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

        <p>
        While installation via the installer script is preferred, if your someone who
        prefers to manually deploy your modules, or if you would like to use the most
        recent development build of the ScsmPx module, this section is for you. Download
        the build that you want to install by simply clicking on the folder button at
        the top of this page that corresponds to the build you are interested in. You
        should note that the beta release is unsigned, and the official release is
        signed. Once you have downloaded that file, make sure that it is unblocked by
        opening its properties and clicking on the Unblock button if it is present. Then
        extract the contents of that file into any of the following folders:
        </p>

        <li>your current user's "Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules" folder</li>
        <li>the "Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules" folder</li>
        <li>any other folder where you want to install the module</li>

        <p>
        Note that it is strongly recommended that the folder you choose be included in
        the PSModulePath environment variable.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once you have the module in place, rename the root folder of the module as
        "ScsmPx". At this point, manual setup of the module will be complete.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="how-to-use-the-module" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-the-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Use the ScsmPx Module</h3>

        <p>
        There are 148 commands available in the ScsmPx module today, and 116 cmdlets
        in the native modules, offering a total of 264 commands to make Microsoft
        System Center Service Manager automation easier. To see a list of all of the
        commands that are available in the ScsmPx and native modules, invoke the
        following commands:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=.Start-ScsmPxIntroduction.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        Note that when you first run these commands, there will be a short delay as the
        module is loaded into the PowerShell session (unless you have disabled module
        auto-loading in your environment, in which case you will have to invoke the
        Import&#8209;Module cmdlet first to manually import the ScsmPx module and the native
        SCSM modules that it loads for you).
        </p>

        <p>
        The first command will return a list of commands that are included in the
        native modules that ship with Microsoft System Center Service Manager. The
        second command will return a list of commands that are included in the
        ScsmPx module. Note that all ScsmPx module commands start with the ScsmPx
        noun prefix.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="get-scsmpxincident" class="anchor" href="#get-scsmpxincident"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Microsoft System Center Service Manager with ScsmPx</h4>

        <p>
        To see a list of all incidents that you have in your environment, invoke
        the following command:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Get-ScsmPxIncident1.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        This data represents individual instances of the System.WorkItem.Incident
        class, and it does not identify any of the objects that are related to those
        instances. Commands invoked like this allow for very efficient management of
        Microsoft System Center Service Manager object data. If you want to work
        with more complex data that includes multiple related instances combined
        into a single view, you can request a specific view of that data instead by
        using the -View parameter. For example, to see a more user friendly view of
        the incidents in your environment you could invoke the following command
        instead:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Get-ScsmPxIncident2.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        This data provides the same information that you see when you access the
        corresponding "All Incidents" view in the management console. Note that you
        cannot apply filters when you are looking up data using a view. In those
        cases, the filters that are defined as part of the view are used.
        </p>

        <p>
        To see what you can do with that data once you have it, have a look at the
        other ScsmPxIncident commands by invoking the following command:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Get-ScsmPxIncidentCommand.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        This identifies that there are other commands that work with incidents. To
        use these commands to modify incidents, you can leverage the pipeline. For
        example, to automatically resolve any incidents that have been closed for
        more than 7 days, you could use the Set&#8209;ScsmPxIncident command in the
        following script:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/KirkMunro/9791294.js?file=Set-ScsmPxIncidentResolved.ps1"> </script>

        <p>
        That demonstrates one simple example to a common problem that these commands
        can help resolve with little effort. Between PowerShell scripts, PowerShell
        workflows, Microsoft System Center Service Manager workflows, Microsoft
        System Center Orchestrator workflows, and now the new Service Management
        Automation (SMA) feature of Microsoft System Center Orchestrator, there are
        plenty of opportunities to use PowerShell commands to automate Microsoft
        System Center Service Manager. Experiment with the other commands in the
        ScsmPx module and see what solutions you can come up with.
